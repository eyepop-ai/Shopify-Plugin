# EyePop Shopify Plugin - Smart Product Generator
## Product Requirements Document v1.0

### Overview
A Shopify plugin that uses EyePop AI to automatically generate product listings from bulk image uploads. Users upload product images, specify what they're selling, and get complete Shopify-ready product listings with unique descriptions for each item.

### Core User Flow

#### Step 1: Image Upload
- **Bulk drag-and-drop interface** for multiple product images
- **Image preview grid** with thumbnails
- Support common formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Max 50 images per batch initially

#### Step 2: Product Definition
- **Single input field**: "What are you uploading photos of?"
- Examples: "water bottles", "t-shirts", "skincare products", "jackets"
- This becomes the base object for EyePop analysis

#### Step 3: Content Configuration
**Basic toggles (all enabled by default):**
- ✅ Product Title
- ✅ Product Description
- ✅ Color/Variant Detection
- ✅ SEO Meta Description
- ✅ Product Tags
- ✅ Alt Text

**Custom Questions (Optional):**
- Add custom questions like "What scent is this?" or "What material?"
- Free-form text input, up to 5 custom questions

#### Step 4: Processing & Results
- **Progress indicator** showing processing status per image
- **Results grid** with image + generated content preview
- **Edit capability** for each generated field before Shopify push
- **One-click Shopify export** for all products

### Backend Processing Flow

```
For each uploaded image:
1. Send image + base object to EyePop ("This image contains water bottles")
2. EyePop confirms main object recognition
3. Ask standard questions:
   - "What color/variant is this [object]?"
   - "What are the key visible features?"
   - "What text is visible on the product?"
4. Ask any custom user questions
5. Generate Shopify-formatted content from responses
```

### Shopify Integration Requirements

- **Alt Text** for images
